Data1700 Oblig

This is a concept web application for order cinema tickets using Spring Boot, Bootstrap, HTML, JS, JDBC, SQL and Java.
The orders are input validated and sent to the backend java REST controller and then sent to H2 database with JDBC.
Orders are also loaded from the backend in to a table on the website where there is buttons for deleting and editing individual orders.
Bootstrap is used for styling.
Its is created to practice what we learn, and as an obligatory task in the DATA1700 Web programming subject.

HTML input Validation in main branch
JS  input Validation in "js-validation" branch
(Not sure what of them is the best)
